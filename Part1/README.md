# README

All the code in this section was done using Python and with the use of pip you'll also need to install; `uvicorn`, `fastapi` and `pycrypto`. `uvicorn` and `fastapi` where used to make a web app. To run the web app its as simple and running the python file. It will host the webapp on your localhost with port 8000 so be sure to not have that occupied. You will also need to clone this github repo ([`https://github.com/yinengy/Mersenne-Twister-in-Python/blob/master/MT19937.py`](https://github.com/yinengy/Mersenne-Twister-in-Python/blob/master/MT19937.py)) and rename the folder to 'MT19937' as all import from each file have that path.

Before using `clientCLI.py` or `Attack.py` you would run one of the two servers; `server_PRNG.py`, `server_chacha.py`.
